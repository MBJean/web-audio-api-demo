# web-audio-api-demo

## Overview
The PR includes a basic website that demonstrates some of the functionality of the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API#example) and the [OscillatorNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode/start) interface.

By pressing "play", the user can generate a basic sound pattern (&#119046;	&#9834;	&#9834;	&#119134; &#119040; &#9834; &#119134;	&#9834; &#119047;). Controls allow the user to adjust the pitch (immediately) and speed (of the subsequent invocation) of the pattern.

A live version of the demo can be found here: [https://mbjean.github.io/web-audio-api-demo/](https://mbjean.github.io/web-audio-api-demo/).
